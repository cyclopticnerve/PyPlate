FIXME: THE FUCKING DOCS_USE_RM !!!

TODO: make pp in pp
TODO: make github repo after template
Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PKG_Test.git

or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# PKG_Test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PKG_Test.git
git push -u origin main
  
or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PKG_Test.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

DONE: add --uninstall to pyplate
DONE: leave template code to fudge path (used often)
DONE: test develop.py
DONE: cmd params not exclusive
-l bakes in new .po
-v bakes in new version

NEXT: how to check for missing keys (see configurator in "other" dir)
NEXT: spinning * at ... Done
NEXT: don't run pm if 'pyplate' in path (recursion)
NEXT: break conf into hook files
NEXT: copy default files from template on make / (bake?)
        also where does each file in misc come from
        this should be a hodgepodge but should template be the master or pp?
        need a chart of sources and dests
NEXT: F.run that runs in venv
