NEXT: make github repo after template
Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PKG_Test.git

or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# PKG_Test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PKG_Test.git
git push -u origin main
  
or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PKG_Test.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

NEXT: how to check for missing keys (see configurator in "other" dir)
NEXT: spinning * at ... Done
NEXT: don't run pm if 'pyplate' in path (recursion)
NEXT: break conf into hook files
NEXT: copy default files from template on make / (bake?)
        also where does each file in misc come from
        this should be a hodgepodge but should template be the master or pp?
        need a chart of sources and dests
NEXT: F.run that runs in venv


NEXT: i18n for error messages and file/dir names in settings.py
NEXT: should we ask for names of files for gui ala module name for pkg?
NEXT: should we run potpy on a fresh project? any benefit?
NEXT: get .venv python version and fill in pyproject.toml? how to determine min
req?
do i have to test against every version?
NEXT: get rid of big/small names - all small? or only for packages?
or convert underscores to dashes in small name (or both)
NEXT: merge top level folders from all and type (to move tests/pkg_test, src/pyproject.toml,
etc from only 1 project)
ie. tests/pkg_test and all/pyproject.toml are only for pkg type
NEXT: use globs in pymaker DICT_COPY
NEXT: convert all with open() to with path.open()
NEXT: format license name in fix_readme to account for missing values
see tests/license_test.py and google doc
NEXT: show output progress in pymaker
NEXT: make base relocatable
NEXT: figure out a regex to reset checklist
NEXT: make cntree accept cmd line
NEXT: think of better name for cntree
NEXT: cntree as separate project
NEXT: cntree accept format string for names ('[] $NAME')
NEXT: combine default cli and default cli_config
NEXT: convert all paths to pathlib
NEXT remove .py ext from executable files
i.e. timeshift, timeshift-gtk
NEXT: add logging to all templates
NEXT: put ALL dicts from pymaker into conf file
NEXT: replace project name in misc file headers
NEXT: move license stuff to pybaker, will need to be done once at first run
can be changed later? would need a lot more regex
NEXT: make BASE_DIR configurable
NEXT: remove json in favor of toml for config files (so we can use comments)
NEXT: add email and version to headers
NEXT: test if MODTEST == ModTest == modtest (for project name)(done in _check_name)
NEXT: ask for author/email first time, then store
NEXT: set project info by cmd line (-t,--type, -n,--name, -a,--author, -e,--email)
NEXT: use globs in blacklist (for skip header images)
but these are hardcoded in SO MANY PLACES
these values would only have to be changed once, so make it a script in install?
NEXT: how to add new items to be replaced? 
all current keywords use a fixed regex but what if we want to do simple text replacement?
like just replace 'PP_SOMETHING' with 'foobar'?
NEXT: combine strings.json/blacklist.json
NEXT: pybaker.py get all dunders from dict? i.e. strings.json uses __PP_XXX__
NEXT: check for gtk version 3/4
   does gi.repository have a >= ?
   load ui file based on installed GTK version
NEXT: icons of diff sizes? for desktop/ui
NEXT: need a better way to do headers that doesn't rely on dunders
something like anything more that 2 spaces is formatted to 80?
NEXT: check for string empty fields that are essential(desc,ver,)
NEXT: restructure docstrings - https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/docstrings-python
also look at official python docs or autoDocstring ext
check for docstrings linter? pydocstyle?
how to document text/json files in docs? add files? and how to add LONG documentation
to docs? i.e. long descriptions of each param?
NEXT: pybaker.py should do replacements first, then do checks
NEXT: pybaker.py: constants to dunders - use find/replace
NEXT: add version number as a heading to README
NEXT: add changelog to README
NEXT: pymaker should only do dunders in source folder and top level files
Same with pybaker.py
Blacklist is too messy - whitelist is easier?
NEXT: document the template structure in README
NEXT: convert pyplate.py recurse stuff from lines[] to text() (or vice versa)
NEXT: move all string-based constants to files in conf
NEXT: releases in GItHub have version number in file/folder name
Makes it hard to overwrite older versions when copy/paste
also correlates to PyPlate readme
NEXT: custom snippets https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets
NEXT: docs module starts at src? need to start at module/package
Does it do the same thing when built?
NEXT: what to do with snippets.txt? do we need it?
NEXT: make py deps have values that are versions (=>3.10) etc for pyproject.toml?
NEXT: figure out what to do with install/uninstall - PyInstaller? Installerator?
NEXT: conf files from json to toml, add comments
NEXT: README: need to figure out if Installerator/Configurator are actually deps
NEXT: README: if there is a file in misc starting with 'screenshot', uncomment that line in README
what to do about placeholder file? and file ext?
NEXT: recurse code in pymaker/pybaker similar... can we combine?
NEXT: make checklist as html/interactive
NEXT: make tree.txt/style.txt as html w/checkboxes
NEXT: change all header date to version ???
NEXT: check cspell
NEXT: run every f-ing linter
NEXT: investigate pyinstaller https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/requirements.html

remove .py exts from executables after installing
(makes them easier/more compliant to call from cmd line)

Use PyPlate to make a project called PyPlate
Install PyMaker like a CLI

move PyPlate/pymaker.py to /usr/bin so we can call it from anywhere
add params for the questions
pymaker -t/--type m|p|c|g -n/--name ModTest
no default, each is required

CLI/GUI: what files to add to install.py when copying
(i.e. apps/cli need to copy files to ~/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app and ~/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app/gui)

Change log should be cumulative with an entry for each version number and date 
of release
Still working on this - need to compare tags but no tags in dev
Can't compare tags in main as changelog will be modified after tag is added

when creating a CLI or GUI app, after creating venv, download and install 
installerator and configurator and build and pylinter
default install script should be modified by PyPlate to download and install 
installerator and configurator in the prerequisites
Add pip install from GitHub instructions to readme
How to know if we are using the latest version of PyPlate, installer and 
configurator
pyproject deps should include inst/cfg for gui/cli but they need to be in pyPI
pyproject.toml should automatically add configurator and installerator for 
cli/gui apps
