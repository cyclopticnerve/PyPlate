X single canonical version?

pymaker - first run specify base dir for libs/apps
store that and use for future runs

add argparse to empty_exe.py
  or make argparse_helper module that can be added if necessary
  
when/where are __init__.py/__main__.py files used? very confusing...
this will be key in calling from command line vs. importing

Change log should be cumulative with an entry for each version number and date of release
Still working on this - need to compare tags but no tags in dev
Can't compare tags in main as changelog will be modified after tag is added

when creating a CLI or GUI app, after creating venv, download and install installerator and configurator and build and pylama
default install script should be modified by pymaker to download and install installator and configurator in the prerequisites
Add pip install from GitHub instructions to readme
How to know if we are using the latest version of pyplate, installer and configurator
pyproject reqs should include inst/cfg for gui/cli but they need to be in pyPI
pyproject.toml should automatically add configurator and installerator for cli/gui apps
