TODO: python requirements
    toml dependencies should be entered in pymaker
    these should automatically add configurator and installerator for cli/gui apps
     

top level OK
misc OK
template
    gui
    misc
    src
    tests
    top_level

X Rename to PyPlate
X Empty files except for header and dividers in misc folder
X modify pymaker to copy all /template files/folders as top level

3 when creating a CLI or GUI app, after creating venv, download and install installerator and configurator and build and pylama
4 default install script should be modified by pymaker to download and install installator and configurator in the prerequisites
5 Change log should be cumulative with an entry for each version number and date of release
6 Add pip install from GitHub instructions to readme
7 How to know if we are using the latest version of template pymaker installer and configurator
8 single canonical version?
9 first run specify base dir for libs/apps
store that and use for future runs
10 pyproject reqs should include inst/cfg for gui/cli but they need to be in pyPI

add argparse to empty_exe.py
  or make argparse_helper module that can be added if necessary
  
when/where are __init__.py/__main__.py files used? very confusing...
this will be key in calling from command line vs. importing
