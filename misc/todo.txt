Rename pymaker.py to pyplate.py
Use pyplate to make a project called pymaker
Install pymaker like a CLI

for pkg type, make sure all submodule names are in __init__.py

move pyplate to /usr/bin so we can call it from anywhere
add param to set location of project

versionator script 

try to use more list/dict comprehensions

add argparse to empty_exe.py
  or make argparse_helper module that can be added if necessary

# Module/Package: get rid of import tests after ensuring __init__.py works
# as expected
# CLI/GUI: what files to add to install.py when copying
# (i.e. apps/cli need to copy files to ~/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app and
# !/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app/gui)

some sort of script to go back after and check that all reps are done
(for files added after initial creation - files added from misc)

Change log should be cumulative with an entry for each version number and date 
of release
Still working on this - need to compare tags but no tags in dev
Can't compare tags in main as changelog will be modified after tag is added

when creating a CLI or GUI app, after creating venv, download and install 
installerator and configurator and build and pylama
default install script should be modified by pyplate to download and install 
installator and configurator in the prerequisites
Add pip install from GitHub instructions to readme
How to know if we are using the latest version of pyplate, installer and 
configurator
pyproject deps should include inst/cfg for gui/cli but they need to be in pyPI
pyproject.toml should automatically add configurator and installerator for 
cli/gui apps
