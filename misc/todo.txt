DONE: versionator script 

DONE: add argparse to empty_exe.py

DONE: some sort of script to go back after and check that all reps are done
(for files added after initial creation - files added from misc)

DONE: keep. .py ext in pyplate/project
(to use linter, files must have .py ext)

TODO: no version num in pyplate readme?
cuz if not, get rid of metadata.py in pyplate and just hardcode stuff

TODO: what about exec/icon paths in .desktop?

TODO: for pkg type, make sure all submodule names are in __init__.py
# NEED TO TEST IF * IS SUFFICENT!!!

TODO: in metadata.py, break py deps into lines and add links for README

TODO: metadata.py : get freedesktop format locations for exec/icon

TODO: metadata.py shows tags in README that are ok (__CN_MOD_START etc)
don't want to ignore whole file!

NEXT: Module/Package: get rid of import tests after ensuring __init__.py works as expected

NEXT: finish argparse test to see if we can count args needed vs. args given

NEXT: _replace_headers could be done better with regex
# (^#\s*)(Filename)(\s*)(:\s*)(\w*)(\s*)(.*)(.$)
# use last group to check for slash, one less space if slash present

check readme for install instructions 
one has big name, one has small name for tar.gz

remove some exts from executables after installing
(makes them easier/more compliant to call from cmd line)

Use pyplate to make a project called pymaker
Install pymaker like a CLI

move pyplate to /usr/bin so we can call it from anywhere
add param to set location of project

try to use more list/dict comprehensions

Check that first line of docstring matches comment block
CHeck that last line of docstring ends w/ a period

check for docstrings - other linter? pydocstyle?
docstring types have params wrapped in parnes, not brackets
where do we use brackets?

'function' not in a class
'method' in a class

CLI/GUI: what files to add to install.py when copying
(i.e. apps/cli need to copy files to ~/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app and !/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app/gui)

Change log should be cumulative with an entry for each version number and date 
of release
Still working on this - need to compare tags but no tags in dev
Can't compare tags in main as changelog will be modified after tag is added




when creating a CLI or GUI app, after creating venv, download and install 
installerator and configurator and build and pylama
default install script should be modified by pyplate to download and install 
installator and configurator in the prerequisites
Add pip install from GitHub instructions to readme
How to know if we are using the latest version of pyplate, installer and 
configurator
pyproject deps should include inst/cfg for gui/cli but they need to be in pyPI
pyproject.toml should automatically add configurator and installerator for 
cli/gui apps
