TODO remove .py ect from executsble files
i.e. timeshift, timeshift-gtk
TODO: fix blacklist.json should be done in pymaker.py
right now fix blacklist is in pybaker.py
does it not do this as part of fix_text(conf)?
but pymaker does not fix anything in conf

TODO: venv doesn't work
TODO: test README instructions for all - latest/clone/uninstall
(and check for upper/lowercase in names)
TODO: how to handle screenshot in readme? should be done by pybaker (after we get a screenshot obvs)
TODO: make pybaker check for empty entries in header (not just dunders)


NEXT: add logging to all templates
NEXT: put ALL dicts from pymaker into conf file
NEXT: replace project name in misc file headers
NEXT: move license stuff to pybaker, will need to be done once at first run
can be changed later? would need a lot more regex
NEXT: make BASE_DIR configurable
NEXT: remove json in favor of toml for config files (so we can use comments)
NEXT: add email and version to headers
NEXT: test if MODTEST == ModTest == modtest (for project name)(done in _check_name)
NEXT: ask for author/email first time, then store
NEXT: set project info by cmd line (-t,--type, -n,--name, -a,--author, -e,--email)
NEXT: use globs in blacklist (for skip header images)
but these are hardcoded in SO MANY PLACES
these values would only have to be changed once, so make it a script in install?
NEXT: how to add new items to be replaced? 
all current keywords use a fixed regex but what if we want to do simple text replacement?
like just replace 'PP_SOMETHING' with 'foobar'?
NEXT: combine strings.json/blacklist.json
NEXT: pybaker.py get all dunders from dict? i.e. strings.json uses __PP_XXX__
NEXT: check for gtk version 3/4
   does gi.repository have a >= ?
   load ui file based on installed GTK version
NEXT: icons of diff sizes? for desktop/ui
NEXT: need a better way to do headers that doesn't rely on dunders
something like anything more that 2 spaces is formated to 80?
NEXT: check for string empty fields that are essential(desc,ver,)
NEXT: restructure docstrings - https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/docstrings-python
also look at official python docs or autoDocstring ext
check for docstrings linter? pydocstyle?
how to document text/json files in docs? add files? and how to add LOONG documentation
to docs? i.e. long descs of each param?
NEXT: pybaker.py should do replacements first, then do checks
NEXT: pybaker.py: consts to dunders - use find/replace
NEXT: add version number as a heading to README
NEXT: add changelog to README
NEXT: pymaker should only do dunders in source folder and top level files
Same with pybaker.py
Blacklist is too messy - whitelist is easier?
NEXT: document the template structure in README
NEXT: convert pyplate.py recurse stuff from lines[] to text() (or vice versa)
NEXT: move all string-based constants to files in conf
NEXT: releases in GItHub have version number in file/folder name
Makes it hard to overwrite older versions when copy/paste
also correlates to PyPlate readme
NEXT: custom snippets https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets
NEXT: docs module starts at src? need to start at module/package
Does it do the same thing when built?
NEXT: what to do with snippets.txt? do we need it?
NEXT: make py deps have values that are versions (=>3.10) etc for pyproject.toml?
NEXT: figure out what to do with install/uninstall - PyInstaller? Installerator?
NEXT: conf files from json to toml, add comments
NEXT: README: need to figure out if Installerator/Configurator are actually deps
NEXT: README: if there is a file in misc starting with 'screenshot', uncomment that line in README
what to do about placeholder file? and file ext?
NEXT: recurse code in pymaker/pybaker similar... can we combine?
NEXT: make checklist as html/interactive
NEXT: make tree.txt/style.txt as html w/checkboxes
NEXT: change all header date to version ???
NEXT: check cspell
NEXT: run every f-ing linter
NEXT: investigate pyinstaller https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/requirements.html

DONE: pymaker doesn't replace PP_AUTHOR_or PP_LICENSE in headers
DONE: rename pyplate.py to pymaker.py and pybaker.py to pybaker.py
DONE: Add author and license somewhere in pymaker so users don't have to do 
find/replace everywhere in template
DONE: what settings do we need in metadaa?
DONE: get rid of project type in settings.json
DONE: remove my name from conf/settings.json
DONE: if link is blank in strings.json, don't make link in readme 
DONE: check that cats end in semiquote

DONE: test category mismatch in GUI
DONE: remove all brackets from docstrings
DONE: other readme headers/footers
DONE: how to document file formats that don't support comments? json!
done in PyPlate README
DONE: pybaker.py: get freedesktop format locations for exec/icon
DONE: put version num in PyPlate readme/update value in misc/settings.json
should we also put other stuff there? or is that getting too close to a "make PyPlate
using PyPlate" thing?
DONE: spellcheck
DONE: diff main PyPlate dir with template (before metadata)
DONE: add reqs/docs/changelog to pybaker.py
DONE: Move all style entries from to-do and checklist into separate style guide

DONE: check for _prj and swap
DONE: check for prj_
DONE: path - whole thing
DONE: file - name only
DONE: dir - up to name or if a folder
DONE: run pip freeze into template during copy
DONE: docs folder is empty in template, so doesn't get into GitHub
DONE: why does PP_SHORT_DESC/PP_VERSION change in misc/empty_main.py?
DONE: __PP_NAME_BIG__ in empty_main.py? can we live with one error?
DONE: in strings.json, make py deps into dict and add links for README
DONE: check _split_quote in toml/install
DONE: gui categories have commas in file, split on comma and join with semicolon
DONE: finish argparse test to see if we can count args needed vs. args given
DONE: put recursion blacklist of project in settings.json (will need default in PyPlate)
DONE: Module/Package: get rid of import tests after ensuring __init__.py works as expected
DONE: pybaker.py: pybaker's own headers not replaced as it is in misc/
DONE: pybaker.py shows tags in README that are ok (__PP_MOD_START etc)
DONE: put blacklist back in for recursing (easier to maintain/move to agnostic)
DONE: versionator script 
DONE: add argparse to empty_exe.py
DONE: some sort of script to go back after and check that all reps are done
DONE: keep. .py ext in PyPlate/project
DONE: initial filename in header of first src file (src/modtest - modtest.py)
DONE: what about exec/icon paths in .desktop?
DONE: _replace_headers could be done better with regex
DONE: for pkg type, make sure all submodule names are in __init__.py


remove .py exts from executables after installing
(makes them easier/more compliant to call from cmd line)

Use PyPlate to make a project called PyPlate
Install PyMaker like a CLI

move PyPlate/pymaker.py to /usr/bin so we can call it from anywhere
add params for the questions
pymaker -t/--type m|p|c|g -n/--name ModTest
no default, each is required

CLI/GUI: what files to add to install.py when copying
(i.e. apps/cli need to copy files to ~/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app and ~/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app/gui)

Change log should be cumulative with an entry for each version number and date 
of release
Still working on this - need to compare tags but no tags in dev
Can't compare tags in main as changelog will be modified after tag is added

when creating a CLI or GUI app, after creating venv, download and install 
installerator and configurator and build and pylama
default install script should be modified by PyPlate to download and install 
installator and configurator in the prerequisites
Add pip install from GitHub instructions to readme
How to know if we are using the latest version of PyPlate, installer and 
configurator
pyproject deps should include inst/cfg for gui/cli but they need to be in pyPI
pyproject.toml should automatically add configurator and installerator for 
cli/gui apps
