testing
  DONE: module


TODO: put version num in pyplate readme/update value in misc/settings.json
should we also put other stuff there? or is that getting too close to a "make PyPlate
using PyPlate" thing?

TODO: metadata.py: get freedesktop format locations for exec/icon
TODO: Module/Package: get rid of import tests after ensuring __init__.py works as expected
TODO: metadata consts to dunders - use find/replace


NEXT: README: if there is a file in misc starting with 'screenshot', uncomment that line in README
what to do about placeholder file? and file ext?
NEXT: put recursion blacklist of project in settings.json (will need default in pyplate)
NEXT: recurse code in pyplate/metadata similar... can we combine?
NEXT: in metadata.py, break py deps into lines and add links for README
NEXT: finish argparse test to see if we can count args needed vs. args given
NEXT: make checklist as html/interactive
NEXT: change all header date to version ???
NEXT: check cspell
NEXT: run every f-ing linter


DONE: metadata.py: metadata's own headers not replaced as it is in misc/
DONE: metadata.py shows tags in README that are ok (__PP_MOD_START etc)
DONE: put blacklist back in for recursing (easier to maintain/move to agnostic)
DONE: versionator script 
DONE: add argparse to empty_exe.py
DONE: some sort of script to go back after and check that all reps are done
DONE: keep. .py ext in pyplate/project
DONE: initial filename in header of first src file (src/modtest - modtest.py)
DONE: what about exec/icon paths in .desktop?
DONE: _replace_headers could be done better with regex
DONE: for pkg type, make sure all submodule names are in __init__.py

check readme for install instructions 
one has big name, one has small name for tar.gz

remove some exts from executables after installing
(makes them easier/more compliant to call from cmd line)

Use pyplate to make a project called pymaker
Install pymaker like a CLI

move pyplate to /usr/bin so we can call it from anywhere
add param to set location of project

try to use more list/dict comprehensions
try to reduce re flags

Check that first line of docstring matches comment block
CHeck that last line of docstring ends w/ a period

check for docstrings - other linter? pydocstyle?
docstring types have params wrapped in parens, not brackets
where do we use brackets?

'function' not in a class
'method' in a class

CLI/GUI: what files to add to install.py when copying
(i.e. apps/cli need to copy files to ~/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app and ~/.cyclopticnerve/proj/app/gui)

Change log should be cumulative with an entry for each version number and date 
of release
Still working on this - need to compare tags but no tags in dev
Can't compare tags in main as changelog will be modified after tag is added




when creating a CLI or GUI app, after creating venv, download and install 
installerator and configurator and build and pylama
default install script should be modified by pyplate to download and install 
installator and configurator in the prerequisites
Add pip install from GitHub instructions to readme
How to know if we are using the latest version of pyplate, installer and 
configurator
pyproject deps should include inst/cfg for gui/cli but they need to be in pyPI
pyproject.toml should automatically add configurator and installerator for 
cli/gui apps
