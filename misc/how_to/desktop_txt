if you change PP_SHORT_DESC, your .desktop file will break. this is because
you have not i18n'ed the new description. the solution is to:

1. run pybaker once to generate the new .pot/.po files
2. translate the "Comment=" entry in all .po files
3. run pybaker again to apply translations to .desktop file
