<!-- __RM_SHORT_DESC_START__ -->
A program for creating module/package/CLI/GUI projects in Python from a template
<!-- __RM_SHORT_DESC_END__ -->

<!-- ![Screenshot](misc/screenshot.jpg) -->

## Requirements
<!-- __RM_PY_DEPS_START__ -->
None
<!-- __RM_PY_DEPS_END__ -->

## Installing
You can download the (hopefully stable)
[latest release](https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PyPlate/releases/latest) 
from the main branch.<br>
Download either the 'tar.gz' or 'zip' file and extract it.<br>
Rename the folder 'PyPlate' (without the version number).

Or you can clone the git repo to get the latest (and often broken) code from the
dev branch:
```bash
foo@bar:~$ cd ~/Downloads
foo@bar:~/Downloads$ git clone https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PyPlate
```

Next, cut/copy/paste the 'PyPlate' directory wherever you want. For the examples
below, we will use '~/Documents/Projects/Python/'.
```bash
foo@bar:~/Downloads$ mv PyPlate ~/Documents/Projects/Python
```

Lastly, you can delete the downloaded folder, if you copied it.

## Uninstalling
Just delete the 'PyPlate' folder from wherever you put it in the install step.

## Usage
To create a project, cd into the 'PyPlate/src/' directory, and run 'pyplate.py':
``` bash
foo@bar:~$ cd ~/Documents/Projects/Python/PyPlate/src
foo@bar:~/Documents/Projects/Python/PyPlate/src$ ./pyplate.py
```

Enter the required information, and 'pyplate.py' will create the required files
and folders in a subdirectory of 'DIR_BASE', where 'DIR_BASE' is the directory
above 'PyPlate'. In our example, 'DIR_BASE' is '~/Documents/Projects/Python'.

So Modules/Packages will be generated in 
'~/Documents/Projects/Python/Libs', and CLI/GUI apps will be generated in 
'~/Documents/Projects/Python/Apps'.

From there you are free to modify the projects in your favorite IDE.

## Notes
If you make any changes to this template to better suit your own style/setup, 
please let me know or send a pull request. I will take a look and see if I can 
incorporate your changes to make them user-agnostic. This way the template can 
hopefully become more customizable to suit everyone's needs.
