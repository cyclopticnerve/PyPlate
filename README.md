## Requirements

None

## Installing

You should first run:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

to make sure you have the lastest software installed.

You can download the (hopefully stable)
[latest release](https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PyPlate/releases/latest) 
from the main branch.<br>
Download either the 'tar.gz' or '.zip' file and extract it.<br>

Or you can clone the git repo to get the latest (and often broken) code 
from the dev branch:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ cd Downloads
foo@bar:~/Downloads$ git clone https://github.com/cyclopticnerve/PyPlate
```
and put it wherever you want it. A good suggestion is ~/Documents/Projects/Python/Tools.

## Uninstalling

Just delete the PyPlate folder.

## Usage

First, cd into the PyPlate folder, then run pymaker.py:

``` bash
foo@bar:~$ cd Documents/Projects/Python/Tools/PyPlate
foo@bar:~/Documents/Projects/Python/Tools/PyPlate$ ./pymaker.py
```

Enter the required information, and PyMaker will create the required files and 
folders in a subdirectory of ~/Documents/Projects/Python based on your entries.<br>

Modules and packages will be placed in a 'Libs' folder, and CLI/GUI projects 
will be placed in an 'Apps' folder.<br>
From there you are free to modify the projects in your favorite IDE.
